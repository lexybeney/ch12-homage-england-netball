# Homage Page Project - England Netball

### The brief of this project was to create a copycat version of a website homepage of my chosing. The idea was to make the copycat site as close to the original as possible, including the animation elements and responsive nature of the site.

This project was set as part of the web development course I undertook by {the jump} school. I chose the England Netball website, as it seemed particularly strong in its responsive elements and provide me with enough challenge to demonstrate my skills.

At the point in my course of creating this copycat, I have only learnt HTML and CSS.

In order to accurately reproduce the site, I used the following languages and technical elements:

- HTML
  - Page anchors
  - SVGs
  - Inputs
  - HTML entities
- CSS
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
  - Media queries
  - Transformations and transitions
  - Pseudo-classes
  - Pseudo-elements
  - Positioning
- SCSS
  - Mixins with arguments
  - Nesting
  - Variables

Please find below a link to the original site and to my copycat version.

There are elements to my copycat that I would like to work on and improve as my technical skills evolve, through adding JavaScript to elements that relied on heavy CSS. For example, the search bar and burger menu.
